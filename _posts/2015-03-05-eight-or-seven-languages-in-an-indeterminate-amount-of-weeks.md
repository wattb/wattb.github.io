Inspired by *Seven Languages in Seven Weeks* and the more recent *Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks*, I am going to get a feel for several programming languages that I haven't really looked at before.

The order will probably be:

* Go - Coming from Python, this seems like a good choice.
* Elixir - At a glance, Erlang looks awkward to actually use, despite the featureset.
* Julia - Python integration could be handy. I hope it doesn't suffer from the core language bugs I've read about still.
* JavaScript - io.js? Node? Coffeescript? I'm not sure.
* Lisp - Again, I don't know which flavour to choose.
* Nim - It's been gaining traction recently, and the syntax looks nice.
* Ocaml - I used F# once and liked it, and it's probably time to get into a language like this.
* Rust - I haven't really used a language with explicit memory allocation as a default. I might put this on hold while the language still changes, though.
