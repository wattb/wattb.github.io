In this first week, I chose to explore **Go**. I built a small irc bot with limited functionality, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/wattb/go-irc).
 

What I like:

* Simple syntax without gotchas - it was easy to grasp when reading code before I'd properly looked at the language.
* The standard library has a lot of nice stuff by default and is pretty well documented.
* The tooling - I'm using vim-go and syntastic (which integrates with gofmt). It just works, and gofmt handles style perfectly.
* Structs - I seem to be using them like I would a dictionary in Python.
* Goroutines - I haven't looked at these in depth, but they make concurrency as simple as can be.
* Speed - Both compilation speed and running speed. No VM overhead and it isn't interpreted, so very different from what I'm used to.

What I dislike:

* Lack of generics - A few times now I've wanted to write "map" style functions, but then I remember that I would need one for each type. I think this can be mitigated a bit - I'm sure I heard of a tool that would do this. Still, I can see myself fighting this in the future.
* Error handling - Repetitive and verbose; I prefer try/catch style blocks.
